Judging Criteria

Judges will assess your project based on your team's
**3 minute presentation which will include a demo of your functioning application**.
Each of these impressions will be translated into a score
based on the judging criteria outlined below.

Make sure to invest time in your presentation.
That's your chance to make the biggest impression on the judges
and show off your final product.
Use it to communicate why you think your project is unique and interesting.

During the event,

Take that opportunity to engage with them!
